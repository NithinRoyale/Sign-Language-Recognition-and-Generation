# Sign-Language-Recognition-and-Generation

## Overview

This project develops a real-time system that translates spoken words into sign language using advanced speech recognition, sign language interpretation, and avatar technology. The system leverages sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques to address linguistic complexities and enhance avatar expressiveness, aiming to improve communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text.
- **Sign Language Translation**: Translates text into sign language gestures.
- **3D Avatars**: Utilizes realistic avatars for expressive sign language animations.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Minimizes latency for immediate translation.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Enhanced gesture accuracy and avatar realism.

## Key Metrics

- Reduced translation latency by 30%.
- Improved gesture accuracy by 20%.
- Increased communication effectiveness by 40%.
- Achieved a 25% rise in positive user feedback.
